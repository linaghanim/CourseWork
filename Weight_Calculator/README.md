How app works: (User perspective) 

1- Submit all information asked for and the goal
2- Submit calories in and calories out for each day (starting today and ending on the goal day)
    - choose date
    - ADD food in a day
    - write calories burned 
    - Submit Day Log
    - loop on all days
3- Show summary to see real weight change vs. linear change in a table and a graph 

Functions used:

Men: BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x weight in kg) + (4.799 x height in cm) - (5.677 x age in years)
Women: BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 x weight in kg) + (3.098 x height in cm) - (4.330 x age in years)

If you are sedentary (little or no exercise) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.2
If you are lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.375
If you are moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.55
If you are very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.725

1 pound = 3500 calories 
new weight = previous weight + (calorie in - calorie out) / 3500.0

Future Development:

This App is basic, can be used when logging in all information at once and everything will be lost after. 
To enhance it, I will create user profiles with login/logout functions and save data
