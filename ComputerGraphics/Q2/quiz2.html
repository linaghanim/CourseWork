      Quiz 2 (Mon 4/23) modify the quiz2.js file
      to meet the following criteria from the initial view.
      The default scene contains an avatar, a light blue cone, and a red ball.
      You are to
      <ul>
        <li> Create a Physijs green cylinder of radius 2 and height 20
          which is 30 units to the left of the yellow avatar </li>
        <li> Create a Physijs green box of size 100x2x10
          angled at a 45 degree angle and centered at (40,30,0)
        </li>
        <li> When the user presses the "p" key the red ball should
          be teleported to just above the top of the green plank
          where it will roll down the plank and hit the blue cylinder</li>
        <li> When the ball hits the cylinder, the cone "jumps for joy"
          by having its linear velocity set so that it goes straight up at
          20 meters per second.</li>
        <li> When the user presses the "r" key the cylinder and ball are
          teleported to their original positions and orientations with
          no linear or angular velocity</li>
      </ul>
