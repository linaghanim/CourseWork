(change-person â€™(you are not being very helpful to me))
result1 : (you are not being very helpful to you)
result adding at end : (you are not being very helpful to you)
result adding to beginning : (i am not being very helpful to i)

yes it matters. since the replace-all method calls recursively on the rest of the change-person ways, it will first change the last pairs and end with the first pair. So the first pair in the list is the last updated for all words in the sentence.
